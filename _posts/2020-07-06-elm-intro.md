Elm is a statically typed, purely functional language. It is intended for use on the frontend instead of or in conjunction with JavaScript. Elm caught my attention as I've wanted to get more familiar with functional programming. It seems as a quite easy to start with, and it has a [nice tutorial][elm-guide]{:target='_blank'} which guides you through writing apps with Elm step by step.

If you would like to see Elm in action and play with it a bit, there's an [online editor][elm-try]{:target='_blank'} with a couple of simple examples prepared.

Here are also 3 repositories with bigger Elm projects worth checking out:
 
* [Simple to do app][project-todo]{:target='_blank'}
* [Source code for Elm's packages website][project-package]{:target='_blank'}
* [RealWorld example app][project-real]{:target='_blank'}

In the next posts we'll take a closer look at Elm, its features and benefits it brings.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜€
