Hello there!

I'm Maciej and I've started programming professionally in 2014.
I've been coding mainly in Java and TypeScript but my interests go further than that.

I would like to keep this blog as a log and a reminder to myself of things I've learned and discovered along the way.

I hope that some of my notes will be helpful for you as well!

If you would like to contact me the best place would be Twitter or LinkedIn.
